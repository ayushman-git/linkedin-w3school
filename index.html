  <h1>Apple Searches for an Identity</h1>
  <h2>‘Our customers want to know who is Apple, and what is it that we stand for,’ Steve Jobs once said. Do we know
    today?</h2>

  <p>Anyone who’s worked from home knows the world <b>Apple</b> imagined is a fantasy. We use <strong>Zoom and
      Hangouts</strong> for video, not
    FaceTime. We use <em>Slack</em> and Teams for chat, not <i>iMessage</i>. Using Apple’s communications software for
    work excludes
    people who don’t own Apple devices, so we stick to what functions on any platform. Apple knows this, yet it still
    ran an ad wishing it weren’t true. More than a bad marketing decision, the ad points to a greater identity crisis
    taking place within the company. Marketing inside Apple has always been about defining what it is at its core. “It’s
    a very noisy world, and we’re not going to get a chance to get people to remember much about us,” Steve Jobs said
    before releasing Apple’s Think Different campaign in 1997. “Our customers want to know who is Apple and what is it
    that we stand for.”</p>
  <p>The answer to <q>Who is Apple</q> was simple back then — Apple built devices, and built them well — but today it’s in
    flux. Apple still builds devices, but it’s expanding aggressively into software and services, and doing so in order
    to keep growing. Apple’s software and services’ interests are often in natural conflict with its devices’ interests,
    yet instead of picking one path and betting on it, Apple is clumsily trying to make everything work. The ad reflects
    the awkwardness.
    To realize the ad’s vision, Apple would have to let FaceTime and Messages work everywhere. But it’s keeping them
    exclusive in order to sell more devices, sacrificing long-term strategy for short-term gain. The lack of coherence
    doomed Apple’s marketing department on the “WFH” ad from the start.</p>
